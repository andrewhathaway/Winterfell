**Generate complex, validated and extendable JSON-based forms in React**

Winterfell allows you to build up complex, multi-page forms with conditional questions, validation and conditional-page switching via a JSON schema, rendered by React.

Winterfell was initially made for a project in a sector that required a large, complex form with questions that would result in more questions or different pages when you clicked next. With an easy to write schema and a high level of customisation, comes a great power.

## Usage

First install [Winterfell via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winterfell)

```bash
$ npm install winterfell --save
```

Winterfell uses a JSON schema to render your form. We will go through that later.

```javascript
var Winterfell = require('winterfell');
var schema     = require('./schema');

React.render(
  <Winterfell schema={schema} />,
  document.getElementById('form')
);
```

## Schema

The schema is built up of three main parts, `formPanels`, `questionPanels` and `questionSets`.

#### Form Panels

The initial `formPanels` entry is used as a page of questions, or `questionPanels` in Winterfell's case.

```json
{
	"formPanels" : [{
		"index" : 1,
		"panelId" : "intro-panel"
	}, {
		"index" : 2,
		"panelId" : "register-panel"
	}, {
		"index" : 3,
		"panelId" : "final-panel"
	}]
}
```

#### Question Panels

Question Panels are the fleshed-out details about a page of questions. We defined the `questionSets` that exist on this page, any conditions for submitting the panel and button information. You should have one of these for every panel defined in formPanels above.

Each `questionPanel` has the ability to have a header and some text along with it that is displayed above the questions. You can define these via the `panelHeader` and `panelText` fields.

Supported actions are `GOTO` and `SUBMIT`. When using `GOTO`, the `target` can be any `questionPanelId`. `SUBMIT` places the `target` in to the action field of the form element.

```json
{
	"questionPanels" : [{
		"panelId" : "intro-panel",
		"panelHeader" : "A quick survey?",
		"panelText" : "Please could you take a few minutes to fill out our survey?",
		"action" : {
			"conditions" : [{
				"questionId" : "existing-user",
				"value" : "no",
				"action" : "GOTO",
				"target" : "register-panel"
			}],
			"default" : {
				"action" : "GOTO",
				"target" : "final-panel"
			}
		},
		"button" : {
			"text" : "Next",
      "disabled" : false
		},
    "" : {
      "text" : "Back",
      "disable" : false
    },
		"questionSets" : [{
			"index" : 1,
			"questionSetId" : "intro-set"
		}]
	}]
}
```

#### Question Sets

Questions Sets are groups of questions. Here is where you define questions with their validations, types, conditions etc. `conditionalQuestions` are recursive and will work as expected.

The questionSet below has an initial radio button with `yes` and `no` options. When you select `yes`, a question asking for the users email address will render.

Each question has the ability to have some `text` associated with it which gets rendered below the questions-label and some `postText` which will be rendered below the questions input.


```json
{
	"questionSets" : [{
		"questionSetId" : "intro-set",
    "questionSetHeader" : "I am a question set header",
    "questionSetText" : "I am a question set text",
		"questions" : [{
			"questionId" : "existing-user",
			"question" : "Are you an existing user?",
			"text" : "We'd just like to know so we can get you in the right place.",
			"input" : {
				"type" : "radioOptionsInput",
        "default" : "yes",
				"options" : [{
					"text"	: "Yes",
					"value" : "yes",
					"conditionalQuestions" : [{
						"questionId" : "register-user-email",
						"question" : "Please enter the email address your account is registered with",
						"postText" : "We will not spam your email address.",
						"input" : {
							"type" : "emailInput",
							"placeholder" : "Email Address"
						},
						"validateOn" : "blur",
						"validations" : [{
							"type" : "isLength",
							"params" : [1]
						}]
					}],
					"validations" : [{
						"type" : "isLength",
						"params" : [1]
					}]
				}, {
					"text"	: "No",
					"value" : "no",
					"conditionalQuestions" : []
				}]
			}
		}]
	}]
}
```

The `validateOn` property is used to dictate when to validate the field. The default for this is `blur`, which results in the field being validated when the user unfocusses from the field. You can also set this field to `change` which will validate the field as the user types, or changes their answer. Setting `validateOn` to `submit` will result in the field being validated when the next or submit button being pressed and only then.

Validations are handled via the [Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) package on npm. In the `validations` key item, you can set your types of validation for the field. The `type` must be a method on the Validator package, or a custom defined method.

A validation-items `params` key must be an array of parameters for the validation method. The value will be unshifted to the start of the array and called up on the validation method in order. For example:

Validation item where the value must be a minimum length of 1.

```json
{
  "type" : "isLength",
  "params" : [1]
}
```

Validation item where the value must be a minimum length of 1 and a maximum of 20.

```json
{
	"type" : "isLength",
	"params" : [1, 20]
}
```

You can also add a custom error message for the questions validaton item by using the `message` property.

```json
{
  "type" : "isLength",
  "params" : [1],
  "message" : "Please select an option"
}
```

To validate a questions answer against another questions answer, you can wrap curly-braces around a parameter in the `params` property and it will be turned in to a questions answer. For example:


```json
{
  "type" : "equals",
  "params" : ["{password}"],
  "message" : "Confirm Password must match the Password field"
}
```

#### HTML Classes

Winterfell allows you to define classes for the rendered form in multiple different areas. To use them, place them in the root of the form-schema like so:

```
{
	"formPanels" : [],
	"classes" : {
		"form" : "form-wrapping-class",
		"label" : "question-label"
	}
}
```

The table below describes the current set of classes.

## Default & Custom Components

### Input types

The default set of components that ships with Winterfell are the following:

- textInput
- textareaInput
- emailInput
- hiddenInput
- fileInput
- passwordInput
- selectInput
- checkboxInput
- checkboxOptionsInput
- radioOptionsInput

You can also define custom components like so:

```javascript
var Winterfell         = require('winterfell');
var MyAwesomeInputType = require('./awesomeInputType');

Winterfell
  .addCustomComponent('myAwesomeInputType', MyAwesomeInputType);

// OR

Winterfell
  .addCustomComponents({
    myAwesomeInputType : MyAwesomeInputType
  });

```

Then you can reference them in your schema like so:

```json
...
"questions": [
  {
    "questionId": "enabled",
    "input": {
      "type": "myAwesomeInputType",
```

### Label

You can overwrite default `label` element with your own label using addCustomComponent with the name `Label`:

```javascript
Winterfell.addCustomComponent('Label', customLabelComponent);
```

## Custom Error Messages

Error messages can be set strings, or methods that are called to generate an error message. They can be set like so:

```javascript
var Winterfell = require('winterfell');

Winterfell
  .addErrorMessage('isLength', 'Please enter some text!');

Winterfell
  .addErrorMessages({
  	isLength : (validationItem) => {
  	  /*
  	   * validationItem = {
  	   *   type   : 'isLength',
  	   *   params : [] //Starts with answer
  	   * }
  	   */

  	  return 'Please enter a value';
  	}
  });
```

## Custom Validation Methods

Validation methods can be defined and will be chosen over methods defined in the Validator package.

```javascript
var Winterfell = require('winterfell');

Winterfell
  .addValidationMethod('isLength', value => {
  	/*
  	 * arguments == validation parameters
  	 */

    return true; // Valid
  });

Winterfell
  .addValidationMethods({
  	isLength : value => {
  	  /*
  	   * arguments == validation parameters
  	   */

      return true; // valid
    }
  });
```
